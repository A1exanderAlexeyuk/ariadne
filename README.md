# ariadne

This package was created as a set of methods for working with data from OHDSI studies.
The package includes 2 main sections: data preparation and charting.
For manipulations, the data.table package was mainly used, which allows you to perform calculations with the greatest efficiency, given the impressive size of the data (in some places more than 10 gigabytes)

Also, a method for categorizing conditions and drugs, implemented by Nadia Kadakova (https://github.com/NadzeyaKadakova) , has been implemented, which allows more efficient use of categorical data in the hierarchy.
